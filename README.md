# Creature-master
Personal RPG project to practice OOP principles and menu-driven operation. A game designed to showcase changing character stats such as strength and intelligence, and body morphing according to these stats and outside actions.

To try out the demo, download the .zip file, and unzip it to your location of choice. IT is located in the master branch.

## Iteration 0
Initial functional demo release. The player can:
- Name a creature
- Choose one of three races
- Navigate menus detailing each stat
- Randomly generate stats and observe bonuses/negatives according to their creature's race
- Completely redo the creation process if unhappy with character
- Save character info to a file

## What's next to develop?
The "master list" of feature ideas need to be reviewed, but the following are planned, in no order of iteration:
- New member functions of charStats to hold info about body parts/limbs
- Physical body description class to tie in with stats
- An ability to generate random creatures with their own stats and race using charStats(?)
- begin looking at creating a demo gamestate to test descriptions, stat changes, body morphs, etc

List subject to change.
