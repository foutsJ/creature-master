# Creature-master
Personal RPG project to practice OOP principles and menu-driven operation. A game designed to showcase changing character stats such as strength and intelligence, and body morphing according to these stats and outside actions.

To try out the demo, download the .zip file located in the master branch.

## Iteration 0
Initial functional demo release. The player can:
- Name a creature
- Choose one of three races
- Navigate menus detailing each stat
- Randomly generate stats and observe bonuses/negatives according to their creature's race
- Completely redo the creation process if unhappy with character
- Save character info to a file
